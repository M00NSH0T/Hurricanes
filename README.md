# Hurricanes
Here's the code associated with my "Predicting Hurricanes" YouTube series. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmLClJE0GmnZ4e7sW_Fu7A

Be aware, that instead of acting like a standard repository with the latest version being reflected by what you see here, I'm going to keep the code I use from each episode in its associated folder. So, "Episode_5" may have a newer version of the same file contained in "Episode_4" but that's just so you can follow along with the series.

Also, the datasets I use here are massive, and so I will not be posting any of that here. If you want to follow along, you'll have to download it yourself using the ftp sites and Python scripts I've written. Just a heads up though, I've basically filled up an entire 4TB hard drive, and I've only scratched the surface of the European data.

Lastly, I'll include a readme in each episode folder to help aid you in using each file, but for the best experience, you should watch the associated episode.
