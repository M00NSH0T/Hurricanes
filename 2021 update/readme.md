# Check Out the Jupyter Notebook

This is a work in progress. Currently, my notebook walks through how to tie into the AWS GEOS16 satellite data, along with historic hurricane track data, to create a set of nearly 9000 views of several hundred storms from space. I combine satellie imagery using wavelengths outside the visible spectrum to ensure we see detail at night as well as during the day, and superimpose a slightly transparent view of these storms over a terrain map of the world, so our images also show coastline and other terrain detail usually obscured by cloud cover, and all but invisible at night. Here's a sample:
